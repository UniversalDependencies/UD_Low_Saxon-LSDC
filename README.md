# Summary

... 1-2 sentences (see [release checklist](http://universaldependencies.org/release_checklist.html#the-readme-file) for README guidelines) ...


# Introduction

...
The dataset where I take the example sentences from contains 18 dialects from both Germany and the Netherlands. Since there is no official interregional spelling, I use the interregional spelling of the Dutch Low Saxon Wikipedia as a compromise, but I also always add the original spelling of the source. In case of more than one potential lemma form, I strive to choose the one which corresponds best to the normalised Middle Low Saxon in the "Mittelniederdeutsches Handw√∂rterbuch" by Agathe Lasch et al.
